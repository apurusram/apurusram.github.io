        overview: `The logo design centered around incorporating a butterfly in lavender, with the main design elements in white to contrast the black fabric of the T-shirts. A sans-serif font was chosen for the word "Girls," with the butterfly replacing the dot of the "i." The word "Squad" was styled in a cursive font to add a personal and dynamic touch to the overall design.`
